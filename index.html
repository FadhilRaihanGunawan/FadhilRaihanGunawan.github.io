												<h3>Visit to NALI 2023</h3>
												<p>REFLECTION: We interviewed participants that were part of the NALI 2023. We were able to find out many new inventions that can potentially create a better IOT world. From educations to cleaning the ecosystem, It helped me realize how amazing humanity is when it comes to creating the next-level technology. The poster that I interviewed was about the development of E-bike Tracking system for Bike sharing in Promoting Transport Resilience. The E-bike Monitoring System at UTM is a technology service to locate and also take care of the E-bikes. It aids students to  quickly situate close-by e-bikes making use of a mobile application, conserving them from looking around. The system additionally allows UTM monitor e-bike places avoiding burglary. The advantages consist of effective e-bike monitoring plus being ecologically friendly. No drawbacks are discussed. Future strategies include obtaining students to maintain e-bikes in enabled locations. Considering that it's still in advancement, There is no individual responses. The representation highlights the favorable effect on school life as well as the atmosphere, recommending it can influence even more advancements. On the whole, The E-bike Tracking System is attended to be a reliable device for a greener as well as far better school.

												<h3>INDUSTRIAL TALK 1: OVERVIEW OF ICT JOBS IN CLARITY TECHWORKS</h3>
												<p>REFLECTION: From this Industry talk, I was able to learn different roles and duty that is done inside Clarity Techworks SDN BHD. They specialized in cryptocurrency and digital asset ecosystem. They were packed with different skillful individuals. They had Ms. Liyana check product perfection through QA testing, Mr. Saiful as the Web/API developer that centralize on critical thinking and creativity, Ms. Izzah Fatini that focuses in mastering languages and frameworks, Ms. Adilatul working in strengthening the user experiences using design, and lastly, Mr. Ridwan that is in charge of Adroid app development, adds design and analysis directed to software development process. They had one important factor that is crucial in the team that implies to any projects in any fields that is teamwork, collaboration, and communication, which is the message or the lesson of this industry talk. We were able to find out how important it is to make good connection, and always have postive attitude and confidence for yourselves. </p>

												<h3>Virtual Talk on “UTMDigital – Our Digital University Driver” And Visit to UTMDigital</h3>
												<p>REFLECTION: We visited the UTM Digital as a whole class. We were able to see where all electricity and internet related activities are done for the whole UTM JB University. When UTM Digital shuts down, the whole UTM shuts down too so pretty much, The UTM Digital is one of the core buildings for UTM. Everything related to UTM smart or UTM portal services is done inside the UTM Digital including support services, ICT services, etc. We went to look at the workspace inside UTM Digital. It was facilitated with meeeting rooms, kitchen, and alot of AC ceiling. We were also able to visit the Data center or where all the servers running the whole UTM is located. It was unfortunate that we couldn't record the visit of the Data center but we were able to witness with our own eyes on the one and only university in Malaysia to have a Data center with 24/7 monitoring and security protection. We managed to interview one of the staff which is Dr. Aruslin Abdullah which is one of the officer for UTM Digital. From the virtual talk, We learned a more informed details about the UTM Digital like how they deliver the ICT services across the university and give a much more pleasing experience for the students and teachers. It provides UTM ID for only UTM students and teachers to access UTM portal, UTM wifi, and UTMsmart. It was overall a great experience to visit an ICT room and Server room for the first time.</p>

												<h3>Industry Talk 2 System Development @ Credence (TM Subsidiary)</h3>
												<p>REFLECTION: This Industry talk was a short but very educational talk about working as Data Analyst. Analytics is the organized technique of damaging down information right into sectors to acquire useful understandings for educated decision-making. This includes discovering inner as well as exterior information resources, refining basic information, as well as taking part in analytics, modeling together with forecasting future patterns. Dr. Qistina was the speaker of this talk and she gave her brief life experience. In 2016, Dr. Qistina registered in UTM's Information Design significant to seek her passion in information, IoT, coupled with AI. After an overwhelming 10-month Industrial Training in her fourth year, She came to be a Social Media Site Data Analyst in a job at TMONE. Her extraordinary job resulted in her remaining on in the exact same function after finishing in 2020. When the task finished in 2021, She was advertised to be a Data Engineer because of her technological abilities. Presently, she operates in AI procedures at Credence as an Analytics Delivery expert. What she learned from her whole experience and something every student including me should take note is that you cannot get better by yourselves. Communication, teamwork, and confidence is the key roles of achieving a bright stable workplace.

												<h3>Assemble PC (lab)</h3>
												<p>REFLECTION: Our first lab which was PC assembling was more of a fun and chill assignment. All we had to do was diassemble the PC componenets including the cover, PSU, cables, RAM, and the HDD. We then would reassemble all the components back starting from the HDD, and the RAM, Power supply, and then connect all the cables back and close the cover. Once done, We then test if the PC would turn on and get no fail when starting and we were able to ace it in the first try. When everyone was done with the lab, We then took a quick quiz about the components and how to diassemble a PC. Overall, I  have done PC DIY before and this was an easy task for me, but I can see that this was an exciting experience for beginners.</p>

												<h3>Design Thinking (Low Fidelity Prototype)</h3>
												<p>REFLECTION:
													Design Thinking was our very last project together as a team. Our task was first discussed in the online class which was to brainstorm ideas with outside teams to find the best idea or project to make for Design Thinking. Every one of us made at least one idea but at the end, Reza had the best or chosen idea by the partnering team to be continued for designing. We then made sure to split our task evenly so everyone has something to do since this assignment was a massive task to complete. Goh Chang Zhe led the survey to ask the opinions of other students about design thinking, and Chua Shang Yeet as well as Chong Zu Wei assisted with recording or documenting our job. Me and Reza was given the task to create the Low Fidelity Prototype and test how the prototype is used. All of us contributed to recognize concerns, recommend options together with highlighting our development's importance. Teamwork was crucial, and Taking part in this task has actually added to the improvement of my problem-solving skills, management abilities, as well as interaction capabilities targeted at the moral and also prominent advancement of modern innovations. In general, it was an effective and satisfying experience that will certainly stick to me for future jobs.</p>

												<h2>SELF-REFLECTION</h2>
												<p>This Industry talks has enhanced my deep knowledge about the technology world. The meetings with NALI 2023 individuals dropped light on remarkable developments, such as the E-bike Tracking System at UTM showcasing exactly how modern technology can boost comfort as well as protection. The industry talk from Clarity Teckworks and the presentation on the experience as a data analyst shows the value of contributing as a whole team to accomplish major projects. A check out to UTM Digital offered a full sight of the critical duty played by technical facilities in instructional establishments. The PC assembling was a fun teamwork activity that gave us the access to be open in communication and work together to construct a PC. Design Thinking was a big project in my opinion since we had to brainstorm our ideas with external teams to get the right idea for this project, and create a report consisting 1500 and above words while also making the Low Fidelity Prototype to present our invention. In my opinion, I wished we had more similar experience as the PC assembling lab because I personally think it helps my team get closer with each other as it was the only assignment that was done physically. It can be about constructing other IOT devices or even anything in general; just have to be physical assignment. This experiences have increased my recognition for the non-stop development of the modern technology along with enhance my social abilities in surfing the innovation globe.</p>
